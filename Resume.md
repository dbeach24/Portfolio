Optimization of algorithms, queries, and data flows | OO, functional, declarative, and imperative styles
Unit and regression testing, TDD | Python (20y), C++ (21y), Java (8y), Julia, Scala, C#
Agile methods, iterative development | Linux (21y), Mac, Windows

## Experience

Over 20 years of software design and development experience covering areas in
scientific computing, financial data, high-performance data processing,
and web/desktop interfaces.

### Vice President, Goldman Sachs, April 2017 – present

* Joined Data Platform Team within Equities Technologies, an operational software development
  and support team responsible for the processing and timely delivery of post-execution trade data
  to many other areas of the firm.  High volume data flows involve 108 events daily.

* Spearheaded project to implement a streaming, parallel order linkage system using Kafka and Avro/HDFS.

* Ongoing development and support work relating to back-end for low-latency DMA live flows as necessary
  to support new business capabilities.

### Software Engineer, Goldman Sachs (via PRO Unlimited), September 2015 – April 2017

* Designed and implemented high-volume ingestion systems for financial transaction data using
  multi-threaded Kafka consumers, and Avro and Parquet file formats.  Responsible for designing
  reliability and recovery mechanisms for “system of record” data involving multiple flows.

* Prototyped and implemented a volume data simulator in Python, generating 108's of events for
  bottleneck discovery and stress testing of newly deployed production software.

* Using Spark SQL, composed scalable transformations to create derived data sets for reporting
  and regulatory functions within the firm.

### Senior Software Architect, Numerica Corporation, Fort Collins, CO, July 2012 – September 2015

* Responsibilities included design and maintenance for large numerical software projects across
  several programs within the company, advising researchers on best practices for developing,
  testing, and integrating new components into these projects.  Lead software architect for
  three programs (see below).

* Space Situational Awareness (SSA): Architected software for tracking satellites and space debris,
  from development of initial framework to fully functioning system.  Supported structuring, testing,
  and integration of new software components for a team of five researchers by establishing coding
  and testing process, performing code reviews, programming assistance, and code refactoring.  Numerous
  contributions to key data structures and performance-critical algorithms.

* Airborne Infrared (ABIR): Lead developer responsible for the maturation of missile tracking software.
  Key activities included software design, organization, test coverage, and tracking run-time performance
  of the software.  This effort spawned several new software tools, including a new “dual-pane” tracking
  kernel, a library of high-performance coordinate conversions in C++, and other reusable libraries which
  were leveraged to improve similar software systems, including SSA.

* Mathematical Finance: Designed and developed software framework and integrated financial algorithms
  for portfolio selection.  Parameters for the algorithm, a combination of
  [Modern Portfolio Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) and
  [Quantitative Value](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Value-Web-Site-Practitioners/dp/1118328078),
  were evaluated and adjusted using a Machine Learning approach.

* Crafted new software libraries used internally by the company on multiple projects, serving a wide
  range of needs including data association, 3-D visualization, numerical testing, and structured logging.

### Open Source Author, Monary, High-Performance Queries for MongoDB

* [Monary](https://bitbucket.org/djcbeach/monary/wiki/Home) is my own creation, born of a desire to
  improve query performance when accessing [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) from dynamic languages
  like Python, in support of high-volume tasks such as data analytics.  It attracted internal attention
  from MongoDB, Inc., and was enhanced by several MongoDB employees.

### Software Consultant, DJC Innovations LLC, Littleton, CO, Dec 2004 – June 2012

* For over seven years, I owned and operated a software consulting business, with multiple clients
  and full-time engagement.

* Designed and implemented software for a family of algorithms to solve the multi-dimensional assignment
  problem, a specialized linear-programming (LP) problem.  As a final stage, the prototype (13 kLOC Python)
  was translated to high-performance C++ (31 kLOC), yielding a robust and well-documented solution offering
  more features and improved performance over previous tools.

* Applied text analytics techniques to create a record matching algorithm to compare product prices between
  a retailer's catalog and their two chief competitors.  The algorithm won out over several competing solutions
  in a “bake-off.”

* Spearheaded the redevelopment of a high-performance cash flow engine which simulates the behavior of
  structured instruments (CDOs, CLOs) over a plethora of future market assumptions, as a means of assessing
  investor risk and breakpoints across a deal's various tranches.  The redesign leveraged features of the
  C#/.NET environment, providing a document model, GUI, and multi-core model evaluation.
